# FIBO Trend EA mt4

This code is an Expert Advisor (EA) for the MetaTrader 4 platform. It is designed to automate trading based on the FIBO Trend PRO indicator. The EA will monitor multiple currency pairs and open trades based on the signals generated by the indicator.

## How it Works

1. Initialization:
   - The necessary libraries, including Trade.mqh, PositionInfo.mqh, and FiboTrendPRO.mqh, are included.
   - Global variables for trade functions, position information, and the FIBO Trend PRO indicator are declared.
   - The trade functions are initialized with a magic number, allowing for easy identification of trades.
   - The allowed drawdown level and profit threshold are set for risk management.
   - The FIBO Trend PRO indicator is created.

2. Deinitialization:
   - The FIBO Trend PRO indicator is destroyed.

3. Tick Function:
   - The EA loops through multiple currency pairs.
   - For each currency pair, the current symbol and timeframe are set.
   - If the drawdown for the current symbol exceeds the defined drawdown level, new orders for other pairs are blocked.
   - If the drawdown is below the defined level, the current symbol is removed from the blocked pairs list.
   - If there is no open position for the current symbol, the EA checks the buy and sell signals generated by the FIBO Trend PRO indicator.
   - If a buy signal is generated, a buy order is placed.
   - If a sell signal is generated, a sell order is placed.

4. Start Function:
   - Auto-trading and manual trading are enabled.
   - A mobile trading panel is created.

5. Optimization Function:
   - The EA can be optimized for specific brokers by adjusting parameters related to stop levels, spread, and terminal time.
